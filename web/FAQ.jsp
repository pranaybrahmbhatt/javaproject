            <h4>Are all the consultants available 24 hours?</h4>
            <p>All the consultants are full-time employees of the hospital; hence, outpatient services are available on all working days. We have doctors in the positions of medical and surgical registrars, junior and senior registrars, and junior and senior residents, thus offering 24 hours coverage in areas such as Casualty, Wards, Intensive Care Units and Post Op recovery areas. Any complaints in the odd hours are first attended to by the resident doctors and,
               depending upon the case, the respective consultants are called in to attend to the patients.</p>
            <h4>What are the facilities available in the hospital?</h4>
            <p>Apollo Hospitals are multispecialty hospitals and offer the complete range of medical and surgical specialties under one roof, with highly experienced doctors, state-of-the-art infrastructure and diagnostic services.</p>
            <h4>What is the mode of admission?</h4>
            <p>You are required to contact the admission counter, where our executives will give you details about the various packages, bed categories and other charges. After finalization of the package and bed category, you will be given an IP (inpatient) number. On completion of all the admission formalities, you will be guided to the respective ward/room.</p>
